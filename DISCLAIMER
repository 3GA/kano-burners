1. OUR WARRANTY FOR THE PRODUCTS

1.1 The warranty does not apply to any defect in the Products arising from:

(a) if you fail to operate or use the Products in accordance with the user instructions;
(b) any alteration or repair by you or by a third party who is not one of our authorised repairers; or
(c) any specification provided by you.

2. INSTALLATION OF THE PRODUCT

2.1 When installing the Product you agree to follow the instructions provided by us on the Website. Please note that we have developed operating system SD Card burners for Windows, OSX and Linux to enable you to install our operating system on a secure card with one click. This process formats and erases the secure card and installs the operating system on it. If you select the incorrect device during the installation process, such as your computer hard drive instead of the secure card, there is a risk that this action may erase information on your computer hard drive permanently. We shall not be held liable for such occurrence and you assume complete responsibility for correctly installing the Product.
